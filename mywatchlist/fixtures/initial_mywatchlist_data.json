            "review": "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is an action movie directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin.\nAfter watching this movie I have to admit that the franchise is improving with it's every release and setting new expectations with every release.\nThe movie starts with a breathtaking stunt and gives you goosebumps which can make your expectations skyrocketed and you will not be disappointed.\nThe plot of the movie is good and intelligently executed. The screenplay of the movie is nicely woven and with some good twists and turns the movie will keep you glued to the screen.\nActing is superb and stunts are the strongest factor of the movie as the movie is full of stunts. Cinematography is beautiful and locations are also very beautiful.\nOverall a great movie of the franchise and a must watch for all the action lovers.\n(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381249/)"

            "review": "This movie is about a little girl who moves into a castle with her mother and becomes a princess. Her name is Sophia. She has to put up with a step brother and step sister who play tricks on her. \nSophia gets a necklace from the king which has magic powers. I watched this movie with my 4 yr old son. We loved it. We can't wait til January 2013 \nfor the new series to start. So we can watch it weekly. It was very entertaining and funny. It was so good that it kept us waiting and watching to \nsee what would happen next. I give it 10 stars. I would recommend it to all who love to watch Disney shows and movies. Has very good morals to teach the children.\n(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2137286/)"

            "review": "This movie was simply adorable. Though I have to say that many people are being unfair or unreasonable about it. Simply because the movie is not perfect does not mean it is terrible. I admit, it \nhas flaws, but the show is not flawless either. I admit that this was cute and entertaining. I went in with high expectations and left satisfied. My complaints \ncentered around a few scenes that were flat out pointless, which, luckily, are in short supply. Some of the new characters are not bad, but the \nfilm would do just fine without, and anyone who has seen the film will probably know what I am talking about.\nI feel bad for Hasbro and DHX because so few people liked the look of the \ntrailer and despised the idea despite how hard they worked on it. And now the companies are at risk of losing employees due to this reaction.\nGood movie that makes me eager for season 4.\n(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2908228/?ref_=tt_tpks_tt_i_2_pd_tp1_pbr_ic)"

For however far into the \nfuture we humans, if we're still here, will be exploring it might be to nearby stars w/robotics let alone the 100 billion of stars in our galaxy & further let alone some other galaxy. And, we won't be dressed, talking, behaving like early 20th century Americans. This film has the same predictable special \neffects CGI we've been seeing for decades. Same old Earth life comically modified into alien life. Dialogue really dumbed down and made even more incongruous given the technical level of each character.\n(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527338/reviews?ref_=tt_urv)"

Its for kids and I can see them really enjoying this even if you have never seen the show you will still like it.(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11832046/)"

            "review": "It's an entertaining sequel. The effects and the story (in the game) were surprisingly good for a sequel. It also took entirely too long to get into the game.\nWhat brought the movie down a notch is the tired troupe of grandpa has to have everything explained 20 times. And the overdone old man routine. Ugh. It gave me flashbacks of Jar Jar Binks. That and a miscast Awkwafina - maybe it's just me, but I found her to be incredibly annoying.\nIt is definitely NOT better than the last one, but isn't a flop either.\n(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7975244/)"

The chemistry between Moana and \nMaui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great \nfor kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!\n(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521164/)"

The theater was full of \nlaughs from the beginning throughout all ages. In the beginning I was worried that Amy Adams would make Giselle seem like some obnoxious daytime children's television character, but \ninstead she managed to please the audience during the entire movie. There was also enough humor to keep the older viewers entertained from hilarious allusions to popular fairy tales and even some 'adult' themes insinuated, while still keeping the film Disney clean. Overall I completely enjoyed this \nmovie and recommend it to all families.\n(Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461770/)"
